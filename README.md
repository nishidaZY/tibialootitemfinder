# Tibia Loot Analyser 💰

A fan-made web app for [Tibia](https://www.tibia.com/) players to look up item prices and figure out the best way to sell their loot — NPC or Market.

> Built with Ruby on Rails 7.2. Not affiliated with CipSoft.

## Features

- **Item database** — browse all tradeable items with NPC buy prices and Market averages
- **Fuzzy search** — typo-tolerant live search powered by Fuse.js (try `gren adargoin lether` → Green Dragon Leather)
- **Loot Analyser** — paste your hunt loot text and instantly see what to sell to NPCs vs. the Market
- **Market premium badges** — highlights items where the Market pays significantly more than NPCs
